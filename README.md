# talks

Every talk has a pdf and/or pptx with the contents of the slides. Some have a README.md with extra details and some have extra source code that is as-is at the time the talk was given.

> Note: Slides do not tell the whole story of the talk, so take the stand alone slides with a grain of salt.
